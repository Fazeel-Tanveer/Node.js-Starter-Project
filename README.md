# Node.js & Express.js Starter Project

This is a starter project built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It serves as a boilerplate template for building any application using Node.js and Express.

## Project Setup

- The main entry point for the project is `app.js`.
- Before running the application, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following three variables:

  1. **dbURI**: Your MongoDB connection string.
  2. **jwtSecret**: The secret key for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
  3. **port**: The port number on which you want to run the application (e.g., `5000`).

Once the `.env` file is set up, you can start building your application using this project as a foundation.
